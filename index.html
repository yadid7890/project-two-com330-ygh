              <li>I have two wonderful dogs! Bonbon and Oliver are both Australian Cattle dogs.</li>

              <li>One of the breed's most distinctive feature is their face masks. Australian Cattle Dogs
                can either have a color patch over one eye, both, or none. Thus, Oliver is single-masked
                and Bonbon is plain-faced.</li>

                I have so many books! I usually buy my books from Amazon, mostly for class but I've also
                bought several for fun or just as a useful resource for my library.
