            <ul class="dog-info">
              <li>I have two wonderful dogs! Bonbon and Oliver are both Australian Cattle dogs.</li>
              <li>Bonbon's coat is 'red' and Oliver's 'blue'.</li>
              <li>One of the breed's most distinctive feature is their face masks. Australian Cattle Dogs
                can either have a color patch over one eye, both, or none. Thus, Oliver is single-masked
                and Bonbon is plain-faced.</li>
                <li>Bonbon loves to play fetch with anything and Oliver loves to nibble your hand.</li>

                I have so many books! I usually buy my books from Amazon, mostly for class but I've also
                bought several for fun or just as a useful resource for my library.
                I'm really enjoying this one right now:
